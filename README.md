# GoAnimate Character Creator
Source code from the legacy Flash version of Vyond's character creator, originally taken from [this `.swf` file](https://d3v4eglovri8yt.cloudfront.net/animation/66453a3ba2cc5e1b/cc.swf).


*Note:* This has been decompied from [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version11.2.0), the inner-workings of which I have no knowlegde of.  If you're interested in modifying this repo's code and re-compiling it, I'd recommend using the same program.
